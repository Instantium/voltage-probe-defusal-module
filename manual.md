# How to disarm a Fluctuating Auto Resonant Trigger

## About the F.A.R.T

A F.A.R.T is used as a failsafe to trigger the main charge in case any conducting wire is tempered with. F.A.R.Ts are usually implemented by multiple conduits that can be grouped into following categories:

A, B, C, D, AB, CD

## Required tools

 The MDV, which is part of every standard defusal kit, is needed to succesfull disarm a F.A.R.T. 
 It combines a Multi-purpose Voltage probe and a ESD-delivery-system into one tool. 

### Usage

 To meassure a Voltage potential between two conduits, both leads must be inserted into the corresponding contact-points. The voltage is then displayed on the high visibility display.

 Just press the red button to deliver a 10000 v esd through the leads.

## Disarming

 All F.A.R.Ts have one common weakpoint: An ESD through a secondary bypass line will render the internal resonator useless.
